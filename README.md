### Differentially Expressed Gene Analysis on Fasting Participants  

This project explores the use of machine learning to classify patients with Crohnâ€™s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, or as healthy controls using transcriptomic data and clinical features. Models including SVM, decision tree, random forest, adaboost, and xgboost were trained on data from 2,471 participants. Using differentially expressed genes and metadata such as age and biopsy site, models were evaluated on standard metrics. Adaboost achieved the highest overall accuracy (82%), while SVM, random forest, and adaboost had the best AUC scores. Results show promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, though further research with broader condition coverage is needed.
